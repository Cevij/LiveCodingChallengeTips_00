 * Let's say we're building a social service for people who like to read books. 
 * With this service, people will want to be able to find books that they've read, mark that they've finished those books, and find other people who read the same books.

1) Let's start with the ability to add users, and list users. 
	Make a function to add a user to the service with their name and email. 
	Make a separate function to list out the names of the users in the service.

2) Next, let's do something similar for books: 
	Make a function to add a book to the service with its title and name of its author, 
	and a separate function to list out all of the books in the service.

3) Now let's make it so that users can keep track of the books that they've read. 
	Make a function that lets a specific user mark a book when they finish reading it, 
	and keep track of the date when they finished reading it. 
	Make a separate function that lists all the books that a given user has read.

4) Now let's add different types of profiles. 
	When a user gets made, we should be able to choose between two different types of profiles. 
	When you view a user's profile, it should display one of two formats for information about the user and the books they've read:

  		a) In the first one, when viewing a profile, it will output: "<name> has read <number> books!".

  		b) In the second one, when viewing a profile, it will output: "<name> just read <book>",
  			where <book> is the title of the last book that they finished reading.
